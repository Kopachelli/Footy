#**Footy Data Displayer**

_Version 0.0.1_

`This is a project using primarily the Dash package
in Python 3. The goal of this project is to scrape
various web pages in the search to grab data old and
new. Once the data is collected, i'll use Dash to display data 
onto a web page.`

`Predominately, the scraped data will have information between
matches, player information, and hopefully at some point 
a machine learning aspect.`
